<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

During covid I had decided to build one of my favorite cooperative board games that is a very simple but also very exciting game to play with up to 8 players.

### Magic Maze Rules

- It is a cooperative game, so you win together or lose together.
- In order to win, you need to work together with the rest of the players to move the 4 different colored pawns around the board, to:
  1. Explore and expand the board by adding new tiles
  2. Find each pawn's corresponding weapon of their color
  3. Escape through the corresponding exit of their color.
- The game makes it hard to achieve these goals, by:
  1. Being a silent game where no one is allowed to speak to communicate directions.
  2. Although there may be up to 8 players and only 4 pawns. Every players gets a specific direction in which they game move each pawn and/or abilities. Meaning if you want to move a pawn NORTH, but you dont have that direction assigned to you, you will have to rely on the player with the corresponding direction to make that move.
  3. There is a time limit!
